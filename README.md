The following code is made in python language with GUI using tkinter. This is a cards game named Blackjack. Here are the rules for this game. Players make their bets. Players are dealt 2 cards. Dealer is dealt 2 cards where the second card is hidden from the players. The objective of the game is to have a higher point total than the dealer (but no more than 21, anything over 21 is an automatic loss called a bust) — if you beat the dealer in this way, you win from the casino what you bet (you also win if the dealer busts). Aces can be worth either 1 or 11; every other card is worth its face amount (face cards are worth 10). An initial 2 card hand composed of an ace and a face card is called a blackjack and is the best possible hand. After the first round of dealing, each player has the option to hit (receive more cards) or stay (no more cards). If hitting results in the player busting (total going over 21), then his or her bet is lost. After all the players are done hitting/staying, the dealer flips over his hidden card. If the dealer’s total is less than 17, then he or she needs to hit (receive a new card). This process repeats until the dealer’s hand either totals to 17 or more or busts (goes above 21). After the dealer is done, the final results are decided — if the dealer busts, then any player who did not bust earlier wins his or her bet. If the dealer does not bust, then the dealer’s total is compared to each player’s. For any player whose total is greater than the dealer’s, he or she wins money (in the amount that was bet). For any player whose total is less than the dealer’s, he or she loses money. No money is exchanged in the event of a tie.
